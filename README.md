# Sunspot_prediction
Porpuse of the project:
Building a model to predict a time series data(sunspot data-set from Kaggle)
To invastigate the performance of different kinds of layers in time_series prediction process (Dense, RNN, LSTM , Convolutional), the impact of different leraning rate,diffrent kind of loss function, and different window_size on the prediction process
