# Sunspot_prediction

## Purpose of the project:
* Building a model to predict a time series data(sunspot data-set from Kaggle)
* To invastigate the performance of different kinds of layers in time_series prediction process (Dense, RNN, LSTM , Convolutional)
* To invastigate the impact of different learning rate,diffrent kind of loss function, and different window_size on the prediction process
